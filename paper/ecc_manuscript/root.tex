\begin{abstract}

        This paper presents the model predictive control of an axial tubular reactor with a recycle stream, where the intrinsic time delay imposed by the recycle stream—often overlooked in chemical engineering process control studies—is modeled as a transport PDE. This leads to a boundary-controlled system of coupled parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs under Danckwerts boundary conditions, specific for this reactor type. A discrete-time linear model predictive controller is designed to stabilize the system. Utilizing Caley-Tustin time discretization along with the late lumping approach, the system's infinite-dimensional characteristics are preserved with no need for model reduction or spatial approximation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing an unstable system while satisfying input constraints.
